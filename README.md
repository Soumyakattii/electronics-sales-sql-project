# 📦 Electronics Sales – SQL Project

## ⭐ Project Objective
The goal of this project is to build a complete SQL database for an electronics sales system.  
It includes customers, products, salespersons, orders, and order details.  
The project focuses on database design, table relationships, and SQL-based analysis.
